The ship is a Byzantine dromon, and has a red flag with golden cross. In the back, we can see three smaller ships and thirteen boats. In the lower zone, the interior of the church of Hagioi Apostoloi in Constantinople is depicted - in the middle the imperial couple and the patriarch are depicted, while in front the gold coffin with the saint's relic. The icon provides valuable information on the architecture of the now destroyed church."

The detailed engraving style of the illustration captures the rugged landscape around the propylon with mountains in the background, highlighting its historical and archaeological significance. In both Greek and Egyptian contexts, propylons are key architectural elements at the entrances to sanctuaries and temples, often elaborately decorated to emphasize their importance."
